The project _Torn Apart / Separados Vol. 2_ describes in visual detail the economic aspects of the organization behind millions of deportations, ICE. Through the use of an interactive map of the United States containing several viewing options and a plethora of information, the team behind this project has created a, as they put it, “deep dive into the financial heart of immigrant detention in the US”. Recorded in 2018 and containing statistics from the previous four years, _Torn Apart / Separados_ dissects and analyzes the humanitarian crisis of 2018 and that which led up to it. 

**The Interactive Map**

The main action occurs under the “Visualizations” tab, where a map of the United States can be found color-coded by ICE award amounts, as well as five sub-tabs that unlock a wealth of different statistics and information. The first two tabs, “Districts” and “Rain” ran very smoothly and provided a wealth of information regarding ICE’s monetary awards per district.

The tab “Gain” explores minority and women-owned businesses and their awards. While in one graph, the one indicating the number of said businesses is easily readable and can be hovered over for exact numbers, it is near-impossible to see the rewarded amount of money in the right-most chart.

“Freezer” shows ICE’s connections through exact products and contractors, but was very difficult to read and comprehend and ended up only confusing me more with its crossed and colorful design. Additionally, I found that despite being told to click play on this tab, nothing happened and I saw no change to the data. 

**Beyond the Map**

Americans tend to explore things from left to right, whether consciously or unconsciously, which made the second tab, “Textures”, a bit odd in my eyes. The introduction and project explanation can be found after the main map, giving the reader a more stilted viewing experience than if there were a proper introduction before the main event. While there was some new and interesting information in this tab, nearly everything learned on the map was repeated in “Textures” and, in my opinion, felt repetitive and unnecessary. 

The tabs “Reflections” and “Allies” were probably my favorite. In “Reflections”, the team reached out to historians, activists, artists, and writers for their personal stories and research. The tab made the rest of the data more digestible, putting names and faces to the plethora of numbers and figures. 

In a similar vein, “Allies” gave access to resources that have been established to help those negatively affected by ICE’s reign. Providing information such as addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, a caring and concerned tone is established in favor of people who have been affected. 

**Technology and Data**

As stated in the “Credits” tab of the project, the technology behind the website and map were both inspired by [this](http://github.com/muziejus/leaflet-quickstart) GitHub repository that allows for the complex map building seen in Torn Apart / Separados. Other open technologies were utilized, including, but not limited to, “Leaflet”, “Bootstrap”, and “Babel”. All data for the project’s second volume was drawn from [USASpending.gov](USASpending.gov) and combined with volume one’s data, which was extracted from ICE/CBP websites, federal records, and news reports.

**Conclusion**

_Torn Apart / Separados Volume 2_ was constructed to inform the general public about the financial aspects of issues surrounding deportation and immigration, in which they have succeeded. Through interactive technology and thorough, in-depth research, the team has successfully enlightened its viewers as to the humanitarian crisis of 2018 that which caused it, leading society into a better, more understanding state of those who might differ from us.
