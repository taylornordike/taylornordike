**Summary**

_The Photographic Life of Harriet Tubman_ is a project that has been put together for the purpose of telling the fascinating and important story of ex-slave, abolitionist, and feminist Harriet Tubman. This website covers the many facets of her life ranging from her life as a slave to the fight to put her on the twenty-dollar bill in a digestible but informative manner. Throughout the website is a collection of both photography and artwork made in her honor, bringing her legacy to life even a hundred years after her death. 

**Content**

From the moment I opened this project, I was entranced by its visual appeal that is consistent throughout all six of the main tabs. The project’s content is divided into these tabs, which include _Home, About, Art, The $20 Bill, Tubman and Durham, and Personal Reflections_, and are lined along the top of the page. 

When opened, the viewer is automatically brought to the _Home_ page, which is chock-full of information. It divides Tubman’s life into five major sections: Life in Slavery, Abolitionist, Religious Leader, Nurse and Spy, and Feminist, giving brief but informative descriptions of each. The information is easily digestible for readers who might not be history buffs, but not passive in the manner it is presented. 

Scrolling further down, there is a timeline including major events of her life that can be absorbed in a glance, as well as a Harriet Tubman zine full of information and artwork. My personal favorite aspect of this tab (and maybe the whole project) was the QR code leading the viewer to a Harriet Tubman Spotify playlist, which worked to bridge the gap between past and present and made history modern. 

The next tab is titled _About_, and the viewer was led to the same five major sections found on the Home page, making this tab repetitive and unnecessary. The following tab entitled _Art_ contains a plethora of art across multiple media, including photography, fine art, sculptures, children’s literature, and television/cinematic renditions of Harriet Tubman. These divisions as well as the succinct descriptions included with each piece makes it easy to navigate and comprehend. However, the same tabs are included when you click on the original art tab, which brings us to the issue of repetition faced in the _About_ section. 

The next two sections focused more on the history - which says a lot as the previous tabs are very historically-based on their own. _Tubman and Durham_ discusses Tubman’s impact on the Durham branch of YWCA, offering multiple historical documents and primary sources to immerse the reader further. _The $20 Bill_ tells the story of the fight to print Tubman’s face on the twenty-dollar bill and how that debate shifted under President Trump’s presidency. This section was well-organized and included a timeline for the more visual learners such as myself, however, the timeline was organized backward which made it difficult to follow. Additionally, the sentence on 2016/04/21 cuts off prematurely and I was unable to find where it continued. 

The final tab, entitled _Personal Reflections_, provided personal articles on Tubman’s life and influence by Annie Han, Daniella Welton, and Veronica Niamba. This section served to contextualize the information provided and apply it to the modern world despite the fact Tubman lived over a hundred years ago. I found the fact it was placed at the end very tactful - they give you all of this information then seamlessly transition into answering why it all matters. 

**Technology**

This project was created entirely using WIX, an HTML content management system and AI platform traditionally used to create a wide range of electronic media. WIX is available to everyone with access to the internet, so it’s interesting to see such a well-developed project using such an accessible platform. However, I’m not sure if this is due to WIX or the creator of the project itself, but I was unable to find any information on the creator(s). I would love to be able to give credit where credit is due, but their names are either not on the website or so hidden that I am unable to find them. 

**Conclusion**

I found _The Photographic Life of Harriet Tubman_ to be a very insightful, informative, and an overall well-done project that did a good job of making history modern. This project made the life of a woman worth remembering a platform to continue impacting us all
