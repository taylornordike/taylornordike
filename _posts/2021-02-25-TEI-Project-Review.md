The world of Text Coding Initiative (TEI) can be pretty scary until you submerge yourself in it and force yourself to confront it head-on. I was assigned pages 48-51 from Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” to code using TEI in the XML editor entitled Oxygen. Delving into Stetson’s world through a TEI lens was new and exciting, and definitely gave me a new insight into the story as a whole. 

“The Yellow Wall-Paper” follows the narrative of a nineteenth-century woman named Jane who slowly loses her sanity due to isolation brought on by health complications. As a class, we looked at the historical elements of the text and discussed the maddening expectations of women at this time and, in a sort of backward way, Jane’s loss of sanity can be seen as a freeing occurrence as both she and the woman in the wall break free of their confines. 

This background information brought me closer to the text and was interesting to analyze deeper by translating it into TEI, which is something I have not been asked to do before. Being given a small part of the text got me close to, not just that section, but the story in its entirety as I considered questions such as “why did she cross this out?” and “why does she underline this word but not that one?”. It was an interesting inside look into the mind of the story and Charlotte Perkins Stetson. 

Before this class, I was unaware of everything that went on behind the scenes of converting a manuscript to a digital version. I ignorantly believed that it was similar to posting a blog when in actuality, there is much more that goes into it.

We were each assigned four pages of Stetson’s short story via Google Docs, where we marked up occurrences such as underlined and crossed-out words, page and paragraph breaks, and formatting and editing mistakes. From there, we plugged the text into Oxygen and applied the code to the desired sections, translating something old into a modern and accessible format.

When going into this project, I was quite nervous about the idea of utilizing TEI. Despite my anticipated Graphic Design minor, I am still relatively new to the digitized world of coding and the like, and this has been my first experience with it. And, in full honesty, I can say I really enjoyed the process! 

It was like putting together a puzzle and making the right things click in the right places, and while sometimes it gave me some trouble, all that did was add to the experience. It was a bit frustrating as I had to start over at one point because the file didn’t save correctly, but I’m not sure if that was the program’s fault or my own. All in all, however, it was a relatively enjoyable introduction to coding.
