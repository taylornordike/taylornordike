Hi everyone! my name is Taylor Nordike and I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University. I am an English writing major currently minoring in graphic design who, when not in class, enjoys spending time with friends, family, and (most importantly) dogs. 
My love for writing and language began in seventh grade with my English class's poetry unit that required us to study and recreate multiple forms of poetry. Being the apathetic pre-teen that I was, I went into the project with little regard and an expected amount of eye rolling. I received the first handful of poems back with an unprecedented sticky note on the top, reading: _You have a true knack for this - you could publish it!_. After a hard year with a lot of academic shortcomings, I was being praised for something I actually found myself enjoying. Once I allowed myself to write creatively, I discovered a catharsis I had never known before, and desperately needed at this point of my life. From then on, I allowed myself to fall into my English courses, opening me up to opportunities such as the National English Honor Society, a position in my high school's writing center, three published works in our Literary Magazine, and a position as Head Editor for my senior year's publication. English had become a true passion of mine, making it the inevitable next step when college came around. 
Entering college, I knew I wanted to write, but all jobs need writers - what did _I_ want to do? I'd always wanted a way to merge my love for art with writing, and after working with my high school's literary publication, I learned that layout, writing, editing, and formatting were my favorite part of English. I wish to work in editing and/or publishing one day, making English writing and graphic design an interesting and exciting decision for me. My interest in the relationship between the humanities and media got me excited to enroll in English 350, where every class teaches me that Digital Humanities entail so much more than I had previously believed.  
Despite its inevitable challenges, I have enjoyed my collegiate level of education immensely. I've been able to pursue my love of music as a member of the CNU Marching Captains, Pep Band, and two music-oriented Greek organizations - Kappa Kappa Psi and Nu Kappa Epsilon. The music program here has allowed me to pursue my passion for music and performance while simultaneously bringing me some of the best people I have had the pleasure of knowing.
