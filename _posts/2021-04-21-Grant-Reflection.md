When enrolling in ENGL 350, I was unsure of what to expect from the course’s content and work. When the grant project was discussed in vague detail in the very beginning, I was quite scared because it was so far beyond any project I had done before. As the class went on, however, I became more confident in my digital humanities abilities and despite the fact I was still nervous about starting this final project, I felt more prepared than before. The deeper I dove, the more comfortable in my ability to make something as large-scale as this project I became.

When the project was first starting to be discussed, Emma Farrar reached out to me and asked if I’d like to work together on this project, and I’m very grateful she did. Such a daunting process was made much easier with a partner by my side and I’m very happy with the product we have produced thus far. We started talking and immediately agreed we wanted to do something related to women, leading us to come up with the idea to create a resource to help protect and prevent women from being kidnapped or trafficked. Our first conversation was fairly broad, but we boiled it down to some sort of mapping project showing hotspots and trends over the past years. With the help of Dr. Stover and some articles, bringing this idea to life became much less scary.

The next big step of our project was creating an environmental scan and bibliography, the former of which neither of us had done before. With some guidance from Dr. Stover, however, we tentatively began chipping away at the scan. We had decided to narrow down our maps to the early 2000s, mid-2010, and 2020s to show recurring trends, as well as include articles and resources regarding prevention and rehabilitation. We hit some road bumps at this point, as there are not as many articles on this topic as we thought, and we contemplated changing our direction to the (much too broad) topic ‘violence against women.’ We ultimately decided to just buckle down and stick with our original idea as it was something we genuinely cared about and wanted to research.

After receiving feedback on our environmental scan, we were ready to start on the heftiest portion of the project, the grant narrative, where we laid out all of our plans in one document. I personally found this to be one of the easier assignments, as we had already done so much planning and mapping out of the project. It was simply a matter of buckling down and putting it into words. This project had grown and changed from that small idea we discussed over the phone, and even now in the last week or so before it’s due, we’re still finding little things to change. Writing this portion really put into perspective how much we had gotten done and it was fulfilling to see how far we’d come.

The project has yet to be done, however, as we are working on our resumes and CVs, something that I personally don’t see being an issue. I have a resume already, it’s just a matter of tailoring and formatting it to fit this project. I see me and Emma as being in the home stretch of this long, but rewarding project, and I’ll be happy to step back and be able to view the product in its entirety. It’s been a scary process simply because nearly every aspect of it has been brand new to me, but I am ultimately thankful that it’s an experience I’ve been able to have. With the help of my professor, my peers, and my partner, this project has been a great learning experience and I’m excited to be able to apply this knowledge in my future endeavors.
